# Lab 1

First lab of the Interaction programming (TDDC73) course for Link√∂ping university.

## Task
Create the same user interface in four copies, one for each of the following frameworks:

1. Java/Kotlin + XML (this solution must be declarative, that is, the layout must be defined in XML)
2. Kotlin + Compose
3. React Native
4. Flutter

### Additional instructions:
The interface should be similar to the picture below, but does not need to use the same icon and element styling
You will only create the user interface, you do not need to implement any functionality
The "top bar" must describe what framework the current app is created in, such as "Example 1: Kotlin + Compose"
